# Startup Success

There are a number of global issues that we face today. Climate Change. Poverty. Healthcare. The world is constantly changing, and it calls for massive and rapid innovation to keep up with the challenges of everyday and future life. Startups are the disrupters of the economy that can cause significant change by delving into the gaps present in our current systems. They shake the foundation of the norm and create an advanced, progressive environment for the future. As one of the most imperative catalysts in our economy, they not only stimulate financial growth, but also to address the needs of those around the world.

Given that they are such an important part of our lives, our goal is to utilize the data analysis skills that we have been building throughout the semester and primarily assess what makes startups successful and why. Success, in this case, is defined by either the acquisition of the startup by another company (M&A) or by the startup going public (IPO). This research goal has scope to dive into many deeper underlying questions. For example, what factors of a startup make it prone to additional rounds of VC funding, and how does that impact their revenue and overall goal? What is the probability that a startup becomes successful given the amount of funding they have received? How does the age of a startup play a role in funding and success?
